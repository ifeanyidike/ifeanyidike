### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Ifeanyi Dike**, full stack software engineer with over 8 years of experience working on complex software engineering projects. I'm very passionate about solving problems through programming and looking forward to work on new and exciting projects.

I'm currently working as a senior software engineer at Howdy Learning; at Howdy, I'm responsible for developing, maintaining and improving the web socket infrastructure which controls the user presence, notification and chat functionalities. I'm also in charge of integrating Howdy with third party platforms through pluggable widgets as well as single sign on functionality. In addition, I assist in maintaining the WebRTC infrastructure, Thinkific, Twilio and Zoom integrations, reviewing and fixing bugs where necessary.

While employed in this role, I've helped to drastically reduce the CPU loads on the Howdy app which periodically crashed the app. This was caused by high public outbound from the socket.io connections, leading to a poor user experience. In addition, by leading and building a pluggable widget for Howdy, I helped Howdy to land many high paying customers who mainly use the Howdy widget on third party apps to interact with their students and communities. 

In my spare time, I love engaging on personal projects and also collaborating with other developers on interesting projects. I also love playing chess. 

My specialities include: Javascript, Typescript, Node.js, React.js, React Native, Go, Rust, Python, Cloud Services (AWS), HTML/CSS.
